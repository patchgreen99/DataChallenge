As part of our interview process, we ask all candidates to build a SQLite database and an ETL program based on dummy data. The code can be in any language you feel familiar with.

We would like to see you load in the provided dummy data, and build a relational data model on top of it that can support queries from a BI tool. Please also find a way to include some type of geocoding for the customer regions in the data set, and load this into the database too. Bonus points if you use an API to do this.

Finally, we want you to build a few views on top of this data model that highlights something interesting about the data.

Our data challenge helps us understand how you would approach a short data integration/modelling activity using a SQL based tool, and also helps you see whether this is a kind of work that would interest you. For the purpose of this exercise, consider yourself as a consultant helping a client build the foundation for data analytics and reporting.
